# Task: Make the public Skill asset boundary portable on Windows

## Changelog

- `2026-08-09`: Synchronized Task state `active` from Skopos.

## Goal

Make the public Skill asset boundary portable on Windows

## Acceptance

- Windows and POSIX asset paths normalize to one portable slash-separated identity before allowlist comparison
- A platform-independent regression test covers both Windows-style and POSIX-style input paths
- Build, focused package tests, and replacement GitHub runtime matrix pass

## Non-Goals

- Change the reviewed public Skill asset inventory

## Constraints

- Preserve the fail-closed exact allowlist comparison

## Admission And Workflow

- Workflow: `tracked`
- Selected risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Recommended risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Selection source: `explicit-override`
- Reason: The work changes multiple paths, durable guidance, configuration, or a normal coordinated surface.

## Owned Paths

- `packages/cli/scripts/copy-skill-packs.mjs`
- `packages/cli/scripts/portable-path.d.mts`
- `packages/cli/scripts/portable-path.mjs`
- `packages/cli/src/__tests__/release-surface.test.ts`

## Ownership Expansions

- None recorded.

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Should this plan change a public contract, route, or SDK surface?** (decision, complete) — Public-facing changes need explicit confirmation so the agent does not silently ship a breaking contract.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Make the public Skill asset boundary portable on Windows" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- Windows and POSIX asset paths normalize to one portable slash-separated identity before allowlist comparison (closure, agent-observation)
- A platform-independent regression test covers both Windows-style and POSIX-style input paths (closure, agent-observation)
- Build, focused package tests, and replacement GitHub runtime matrix pass (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- No durable Memory obligation is inferred.
