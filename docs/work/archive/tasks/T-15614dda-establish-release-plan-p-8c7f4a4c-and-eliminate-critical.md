# Task: Establish release Plan P-8c7f4a4c and eliminate critical or high production dependency vulnerabilities

## Changelog

- `2026-08-06`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Establish release Plan P-8c7f4a4c and eliminate critical or high production dependency vulnerabilities

## Acceptance

- The release Plan defines ordered workstreams, explicit blockers, evidence requirements, release-day controls, rollback, and post-release promotion criteria.
- The production dependency audit reports zero critical and zero high vulnerabilities without weakening the bundled CLI contract.

## Non-Goals

- Publish, tag, or promote any package.

## Constraints

- Preserve the accepted @skopos/cli@0.1.0 next-tag bundled release contract.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/work/plans/P-8c7f4a4c-prepare-and-certify-the-first-safe-public-release-of-sko.md`
- `package.json`
- `packages/cli/package.json`
- `packages/ui/package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Establish release Plan P-8c7f4a4c and eliminate critical or high production dependency vulnerabilities" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- [x] **Build routed Skopos console app** (action, complete) — Required by Guard ui.console-build.
- [x] **Capture responsive and accessibility proof** (action, complete) — Required by Guard ui.accessibility-proof.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Action `ui.build-console-app`: Required by Guard ui.console-build.
- Action `ui.capture-responsive-proof`: Required by Guard ui.accessibility-proof.
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`
- Guard `ui.accessibility-proof`
- Guard `ui.console-build`

## Evidence And Readiness

- The release Plan defines ordered workstreams, explicit blockers, evidence requirements, release-day controls, rollback, and post-release promotion criteria. (closure, agent-observation)
- The production dependency audit reports zero critical and zero high vulnerabilities without weakening the bundled CLI contract. (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard ui.accessibility-proof: UI changes require browser accessibility proof (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard ui.console-build: Console changes require build Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] architecture: High-impact work must review and synchronize the existing architecture Memory for Scope skopos. (target: `docs/architecture/00-architecture.md`); resolution: reviewed-no-change

## Portable Task State

This machine-readable block is the durable source used to rebuild local Skopos state.
