# Task: Archive the resolved shared-derived Evidence freshness Finding

## Changelog

- `2026-08-04`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Archive the resolved shared-derived Evidence freshness Finding

## Acceptance

- The resolved Finding is historical under docs/findings/archive with proof and resolution recorded.
- Active Decision and Plan references resolve to the archived Finding while the selection and portability Finding remains active.

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`
- `docs/findings/F-20260804-self-hosted-derived-output-evidence-cycle.md`
- `docs/findings/archive/F-20260804-self-hosted-derived-output-evidence-cycle.md`
- `docs/work/plans/P-20260804-skill-capability-hard-cut-and-judgment-pack-plan.md`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Archive the resolved shared-derived Evidence freshness Finding" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.

## Actions And Guards

- No Action or Guard is selected.

## Evidence And Readiness

- The resolved Finding is historical under docs/findings/archive with proof and resolution recorded. (closure, agent-observation)
- Active Decision and Plan references resolve to the archived Finding while the selection and portability Finding remains active. (closure, agent-observation)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] decision: The declared Task scope owns canonical decision Memory at docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md; review and synchronize it if project truth changes. (target: `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`); resolution: memory-updated
