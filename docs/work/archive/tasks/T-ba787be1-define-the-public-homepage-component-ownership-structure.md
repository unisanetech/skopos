# Task: Define the public homepage component ownership structure

## Changelog

- `2026-08-10`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Define the public homepage component ownership structure

## Acceptance

- The homepage Plan defines a feature-first source tree, import direction, Unisane registry boundary, Server and Client Component boundary, and shared-component promotion rule.

## Non-Goals

- Scaffold or implement apps/web in this Task.

## Constraints

- Keep the structure proportional to a one-page public site and do not copy the internal console hierarchy mechanically.

## Admission And Workflow

- Workflow: `tracked`
- Selected risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Recommended risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Selection source: `explicit-override`
- Reason: The work changes multiple paths, durable guidance, configuration, or a normal coordinated surface.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/work/plans/P-7dde6750-design-and-deliver-the-public-skopos-homepage.md`

## Ownership Expansions

- None recorded.

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Should this plan change a public contract, route, or SDK surface?** (decision, complete) — Public-facing changes need explicit confirmation so the agent does not silently ship a breaking contract.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Define the public homepage component ownership structure" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.

## Actions And Guards

- No Action or Guard is selected.

## Evidence And Readiness

- The homepage Plan defines a feature-first source tree, import direction, Unisane registry boundary, Server and Client Component boundary, and shared-component promotion rule. (closure, agent-observation)

## Memory Obligations

- No durable Memory obligation is inferred.
