# Task: Remove routed console accessibility blockers exposed by browser proof

## Changelog

- `2026-08-04`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Remove routed console accessibility blockers exposed by browser proof

## Acceptance

- Collapsed accordion content is removed from keyboard interaction while preserving trigger semantics.
- Nested page scroll regions are keyboard accessible without exposing a visible scrollbar.
- Focused component tests cover both corrected accessibility contracts.
- The registered responsive browser proof passes every required route and viewport with no serious or critical Axe violation.

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Owned Paths

- `packages/ui/src/__tests__/content-section.test.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/__tests__/url-routing-contract.test.ts`
- `packages/ui/src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/patterns/shells/page-frame.tsx`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Should this plan change a public contract, route, or SDK surface?** (decision, complete) — Public-facing changes need explicit confirmation so the agent does not silently ship a breaking contract.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Remove routed console accessibility blockers exposed by browser proof" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- [x] **Build routed Skopos console app** (action, complete) — Required by Guard ui.console-build.
- [x] **Capture responsive and accessibility proof** (action, complete) — Required by Guard ui.accessibility-proof.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Action `ui.build-console-app`: Required by Guard ui.console-build.
- Action `ui.capture-responsive-proof`: Required by Guard ui.accessibility-proof.
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`
- Guard `ui.accessibility-proof`
- Guard `ui.console-build`

## Evidence And Readiness

- Collapsed accordion content is removed from keyboard interaction while preserving trigger semantics. (closure, agent-observation)
- Nested page scroll regions are keyboard accessible without exposing a visible scrollbar. (closure, agent-observation)
- Focused component tests cover both corrected accessibility contracts. (closure, agent-observation)
- The registered responsive browser proof passes every required route and viewport with no serious or critical Axe violation. (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard ui.accessibility-proof: UI changes require browser accessibility proof (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard ui.console-build: Console changes require build Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- No durable Memory obligation is inferred.

## Portable Task State
