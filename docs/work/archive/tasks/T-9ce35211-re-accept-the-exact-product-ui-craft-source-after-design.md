# Task: Re-accept the exact Product UI Craft source after design-system conformance correction

## Changelog

- `2026-08-06`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Re-accept the exact Product UI Craft source after design-system conformance correction

## Acceptance

- All eight declared Product UI Craft fixtures pass against the corrected pack and Skopos binding
- The accepted binding pins the exact corrected pack, evaluation, project, and capability identities

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Owned Paths

- `tools/skopos/skills/ui.product-craft.json`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Re-accept the exact Product UI Craft source after design-system conformance correction" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Refresh self-hosted knowledge state** (action, complete) — Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `maintenance.refresh-knowledge`: Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- Guard `knowledge.refresh`

## Evidence And Readiness

- All eight declared Product UI Craft fixtures pass against the corrected pack and Skopos binding (closure, agent-observation)
- The accepted binding pins the exact corrected pack, evaluation, project, and capability identities (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard knowledge.refresh: Operating-model declarations require refreshed local knowledge (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- No durable Memory obligation is inferred.

## Portable Task State

This machine-readable block is the durable source used to rebuild local Skopos state.
