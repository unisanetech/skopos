# Task: Certify Product UI Craft efficacy with the frozen real paired evaluation

## Changelog

- `2026-08-05`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Certify Product UI Craft efficacy with the frozen real paired evaluation

## Acceptance

- A frozen eight-case no-Skill versus Product UI Craft run uses isolated real Codex workers and blinded rubric-only reviewers with exact identities
- The run records valid, invalid, and aborted cases plus wins, losses, ties, authority regressions, supervision or correction signals, token usage, and subjective visual evidence without post-outcome tuning
- Machine-readable artifacts retain partial evidence and truthfully support the promotion decision
- Decision 040, the Skill Finding, and the Skill Plan reflect only verified outcomes
- Selected Actions and Guards pass and closure Readiness has no missing Evidence

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- None declared.

- `docs/findings/F-20260804-skill-selection-proof-and-portability-gap.md`
- `docs/work/plans/P-20260804-skill-capability-hard-cut-and-judgment-pack-plan.md`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Certify Product UI Craft efficacy with the frozen real paired evaluation" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Refresh self-hosted knowledge state** (action, complete) — Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `maintenance.refresh-knowledge`: Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `knowledge.refresh`
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- A frozen eight-case no-Skill versus Product UI Craft run uses isolated real Codex workers and blinded rubric-only reviewers with exact identities (closure, agent-observation)
- The run records valid, invalid, and aborted cases plus wins, losses, ties, authority regressions, supervision or correction signals, token usage, and subjective visual evidence without post-outcome tuning (closure, agent-observation)
- Machine-readable artifacts retain partial evidence and truthfully support the promotion decision (closure, agent-observation)
- Decision 040, the Skill Finding, and the Skill Plan reflect only verified outcomes (closure, agent-observation)
- Selected Actions and Guards pass and closure Readiness has no missing Evidence (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard knowledge.refresh: Operating-model declarations require refreshed local knowledge (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] decision: The declared Task scope owns canonical decision Memory at docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md; review and synchronize it if project truth changes. (target: `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`); resolution: memory-updated
