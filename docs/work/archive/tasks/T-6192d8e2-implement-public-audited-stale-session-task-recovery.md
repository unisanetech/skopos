# Task: Implement public audited stale Session Task recovery

## Changelog

- `2026-08-03`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Implement public audited stale Session Task recovery

## Acceptance

- A live writer Session can atomically resume or release a Task reserved by a stale Session without the stale Session acting
- Recovery fails closed for contamination and open mutations and reports prior/new Session, actor, generation, ledger state, reason, and outcome
- Concurrent recovery attempts produce one winner through the coordination database
- CLI and canonical architecture expose the same recovery contract

## Non-Goals

- Implement Task work dispositions in this Task; they follow as the next bounded Task

## Constraints

- Preserve Task mutation attribution and require a live replacement writer
- Do not require the stale Session to execute any recovery command

## Owned Paths

- `docs/architecture/agent-native-operating-model.md`
- `docs/decisions/D-20260803-audited-stale-session-task-recovery.md`
- `docs/findings/F-20260803-session-task-recovery-and-disposition-gap.md`
- `docs/work/plans/P-e7e888e6-canonical-product-convergence.md`
- `packages/cli/src/__tests__/coordination-broker.test.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/cli/commands/coordination.ts`
- `packages/model/src/contracts/skopos-coordination.ts`
- `packages/runtime/src/application/coordination/coordination.service.ts`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Should this plan change a public contract, route, or SDK surface?** (decision, complete) — Public-facing changes need explicit confirmation so the agent does not silently ship a breaking contract.
- [x] **Does this plan change authentication, authorization, privacy, or security-sensitive behavior?** (decision, complete) — Security and privacy decisions should be confirmed explicitly before the agent modifies behavior.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Implement public audited stale Session Task recovery" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- A live writer Session can atomically resume or release a Task reserved by a stale Session without the stale Session acting (closure, agent-observation)
- Recovery fails closed for contamination and open mutations and reports prior/new Session, actor, generation, ledger state, reason, and outcome (closure, agent-observation)
- Concurrent recovery attempts produce one winner through the coordination database (closure, agent-observation)
- CLI and canonical architecture expose the same recovery contract (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] architecture: The declared Task scope owns canonical architecture Memory at docs/architecture/agent-native-operating-model.md; review and synchronize it if project truth changes. (target: `docs/architecture/agent-native-operating-model.md`); resolution: memory-updated

## Portable Task State
