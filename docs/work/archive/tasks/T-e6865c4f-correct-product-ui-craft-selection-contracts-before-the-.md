# Task: Correct Product UI Craft selection contracts before the isolated Unisane UI dashboard canary

## Changelog

- `2026-08-05`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Correct Product UI Craft selection contracts before the isolated Unisane UI dashboard canary

## Acceptance

- Product UI Craft applicability uses only canonical Skopos Scope kinds and the packed loader rejects invalid pseudo-kinds.
- A canonical application Scope without frontend/product-ui aliases selects intended module-local context and capabilities despite unrelated preservation constraints.
- All six deterministic selection fixtures and focused selection/runtime tests preserve exact acceptance, locality, budget, generated-output, and visual-restraint behavior.
- The changed pack identity is re-evaluated and re-accepted; focused tests, typecheck, and knowledge refresh pass.
- Decision 040, the Skill Finding, and Skill Plan record the verified real-canary selection gap and correction without claiming dashboard efficacy.

## Non-Goals

- Do not build the ecommerce dashboard inside this correction Task.
- Do not add another Skill pack or restart paired model evaluation.

## Constraints

- Use the schemaVersion 1 pre-release clean hard cut; do not add aliases, migrations, fallback readers, or dual paths.
- Preserve the dirty worktree, T-28e5cb45, both live Unisane and Skopos projects, and unrelated active Tasks.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/findings/F-20260804-skill-selection-proof-and-portability-gap.md`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Should this plan change a public contract, route, or SDK surface?** (decision, complete) — Public-facing changes need explicit confirmation so the agent does not silently ship a breaking contract.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Correct Product UI Craft selection contracts before the isolated Unisane UI dashboard canary" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Refresh self-hosted knowledge state** (action, complete) — Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `maintenance.refresh-knowledge`: Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `knowledge.refresh`
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- Product UI Craft applicability uses only canonical Skopos Scope kinds and the packed loader rejects invalid pseudo-kinds. (closure, agent-observation)
- A canonical application Scope without frontend/product-ui aliases selects intended module-local context and capabilities despite unrelated preservation constraints. (closure, agent-observation)
- All six deterministic selection fixtures and focused selection/runtime tests preserve exact acceptance, locality, budget, generated-output, and visual-restraint behavior. (closure, agent-observation)
- The changed pack identity is re-evaluated and re-accepted; focused tests, typecheck, and knowledge refresh pass. (closure, agent-observation)
- Decision 040, the Skill Finding, and Skill Plan record the verified real-canary selection gap and correction without claiming dashboard efficacy. (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard knowledge.refresh: Operating-model declarations require refreshed local knowledge (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] decision: The declared Task scope owns canonical decision Memory at docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md; review and synchronize it if project truth changes. (target: `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`); resolution: memory-updated
