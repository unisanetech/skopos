# Task: Extend internal horizontal dividers across the section frame

## Changelog

- `2026-08-11`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Extend internal horizontal dividers across the section frame

## Acceptance

- Internal horizontal dividers span from the left rail to the right rail across workstream, promise, boundary, and footer sections while content remains padded and responsive.

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Admission And Workflow

- Workflow: `tracked`
- Selected risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Recommended risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Selection source: `automatic`
- Reason: The work changes multiple paths, durable guidance, configuration, or a normal coordinated surface.

## Owned Paths

- `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
- `design-qa.md`

## Ownership Expansions

- None recorded.

## Steps

- [ ] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, skipped) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Extend internal horizontal dividers across the section frame" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.

## Actions And Guards

- No Action or Guard is selected.

## Evidence And Readiness

- Internal horizontal dividers span from the left rail to the right rail across workstream, promise, boundary, and footer sections while content remains padded and responsive. (closure, agent-observation)

## Memory Obligations

- No durable Memory obligation is inferred.

## Portable Task State

This machine-readable block is the durable source used to rebuild local Skopos state.
