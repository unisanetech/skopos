# Task: Normalize portable task paths and stabilize Windows lifecycle proof

## Changelog

- `2026-08-07`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Normalize portable task paths and stabilize Windows lifecycle proof

## Acceptance

- Portable trackedDocumentPath values use forward slashes on every operating system.
- The Windows lifecycle suite completes without timeout-driven cleanup residue.

## Non-Goals

- Change Task document locations or relax lifecycle assertions.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Owned Paths

- `packages/cli/src/__tests__/task-portability.test.ts`
- `packages/runtime/src/application/task/task.service.ts`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Normalize portable task paths and stabilize Windows lifecycle proof" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- Portable trackedDocumentPath values use forward slashes on every operating system. (closure, agent-observation)
- The Windows lifecycle suite completes without timeout-driven cleanup residue. (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] architecture: High-impact work must review and synchronize the existing architecture Memory for Scope skopos. (target: `docs/architecture/00-architecture.md`); resolution: reviewed-no-change

## Portable Task State

This machine-readable block is the durable source used to rebuild local Skopos state.
