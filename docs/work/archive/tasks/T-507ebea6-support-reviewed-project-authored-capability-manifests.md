# Task: Support reviewed project-authored capability manifests

## Changelog

- `2026-07-29`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Support reviewed project-authored capability manifests

## Acceptance

- Manual capability candidates can bind exact reviewed Action and Guard manifests
- Approval digest includes reviewed declarations and apply validates candidate command, collisions, and providers
- Focused tests and closure proof pass

## Non-Goals

- Add project-specific detection rules to Skopos core

## Constraints

- Preserve proposal non-authority and explicit approval

## Owned Paths

- `docs/architecture`
- `docs/guides`
- `packages/cli`
- `packages/indexer`
- `packages/mcp`
- `packages/model`
- `packages/runtime`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Does this plan change authentication, authorization, privacy, or security-sensitive behavior?** (decision, complete) — Security and privacy decisions should be confirmed explicitly before the agent modifies behavior.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Support reviewed project-authored capability manifests" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- Manual capability candidates can bind exact reviewed Action and Guard manifests (closure, agent-observation)
- Approval digest includes reviewed declarations and apply validates candidate command, collisions, and providers (closure, agent-observation)
- Focused tests and closure proof pass (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)
