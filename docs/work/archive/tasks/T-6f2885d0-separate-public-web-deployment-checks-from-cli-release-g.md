# Task: Separate public web deployment checks from CLI release gates and record the offline font build blocker

## Changelog

- `2026-08-11`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Separate public web deployment checks from CLI release gates and record the offline font build blocker

## Acceptance

- CLI build, test, typecheck, and release smoke exclude @skopos/web
- Explicit web build, test, and typecheck commands remain available
- Release Memory records that the web build currently requires a Google font network fetch

## Non-Goals

- Do not change homepage design or claim broader web completion

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Admission And Workflow

- Workflow: `strict`
- Selected risk/detail: `high-impact` / `detailed`
- Recommended risk/detail: `high-impact` / `detailed`
- Selection source: `explicit-override`
- Reason: The goal contains high-impact signals: deployment, release.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/findings/F-20260811-public-web-build-and-cli-release-gate-coupling.md`
- `docs/work/plans/P-8c7f4a4c-prepare-and-certify-the-first-safe-public-release-of-sko.md`
- `package.json`

## Ownership Expansions

- None recorded.

## Steps

- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Separate public web deployment checks from CLI release gates and record the offline font build blocker" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- CLI build, test, typecheck, and release smoke exclude @skopos/web (closure, agent-observation)
- Explicit web build, test, and typecheck commands remain available (closure, agent-observation)
- Release Memory records that the web build currently requires a Google font network fetch (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] architecture: High-impact work must review and synchronize the existing architecture Memory for Scope skopos. (target: `docs/architecture/00-architecture.md`); resolution: reviewed-no-change

## Portable Task State

This machine-readable block is the durable source used to rebuild local Skopos state.
