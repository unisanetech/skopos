# Task: Freeze the second Product UI Craft efficacy suite for the archetype-aware accepted source

## Changelog

- `2026-08-05`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Freeze the second Product UI Craft efficacy suite for the archetype-aware accepted source

## Acceptance

- The prior 2-6 result and authority regression remain bound to historical Task T-d64f23b2 and immutable snapshot S-baa17a745170, not the revised accepted Skill identity.
- One frozen successor suite covers distinct operational, transactional, discovery, documentation, responsive, and product-character surfaces with case-local templates and only declared rubric dimensions.
- The canonical runner binds every template and accepted Skill identity, preserves isolated blinded arms, emits the exact smoke/full call matrix and token ceilings, and completes a no-model preflight without starting paid calls.
- Focused suite/runtime tests, all six deterministic fixtures, exact re-acceptance, selected Actions and Guards, immutable snapshot, and closure Readiness pass before any real smoke authorization is requested.

## Non-Goals

- Do not execute real worker or reviewer model calls in this preparation Task.
- Do not add another Skill pack or evaluation authority.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`
- `docs/findings/F-20260804-skill-selection-proof-and-portability-gap.md`
- `docs/work/plans/P-20260804-skill-capability-hard-cut-and-judgment-pack-plan.md`
- `packages/cli/src/__tests__/skill-evaluations.test.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/benchmarks/product-ui-craft-efficacy.ts`
- `skill-packs/ui/product-craft/evaluations/core.suite.json`
- `skill-packs/ui/product-craft/evaluations/templates`
- `tools/skopos/skills/ui.product-craft.json`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Freeze the second Product UI Craft efficacy suite for the archetype-aware accepted source" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Refresh self-hosted knowledge state** (action, complete) — Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `maintenance.refresh-knowledge`: Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `knowledge.refresh`
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- The prior 2-6 result and authority regression remain bound to historical Task T-d64f23b2 and immutable snapshot S-baa17a745170, not the revised accepted Skill identity. (closure, agent-observation)
- One frozen successor suite covers distinct operational, transactional, discovery, documentation, responsive, and product-character surfaces with case-local templates and only declared rubric dimensions. (closure, agent-observation)
- The canonical runner binds every template and accepted Skill identity, preserves isolated blinded arms, emits the exact smoke/full call matrix and token ceilings, and completes a no-model preflight without starting paid calls. (closure, agent-observation)
- Focused suite/runtime tests, all six deterministic fixtures, exact re-acceptance, selected Actions and Guards, immutable snapshot, and closure Readiness pass before any real smoke authorization is requested. (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard knowledge.refresh: Operating-model declarations require refreshed local knowledge (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] decision: The declared Task scope owns canonical decision Memory at docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md; review and synchronize it if project truth changes. (target: `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`); resolution: memory-updated
