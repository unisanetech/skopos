# Task: Execute deterministic Skill fixtures from versioned pack sources

## Changelog

- `2026-08-04`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Execute deterministic Skill fixtures from versioned pack sources

## Acceptance

- Every declared Skill proof fixture resolves to one strict versioned fixture manifest and undeclared or duplicate fixtures fail validation.
- The runtime executes positive, negative, ambiguous, generated-output, capability-locality, and budget fixtures without a model or network call.
- Fixture reports bind exact pack, binding, project-source, capability, policy, rubric, and fixture identities and remain generated non-authoritative views.
- The Product UI Craft pack replaces prose-only selection fixtures with executable manifests and all deterministic expectations pass.

## Non-Goals

- Do not add paired model forward tests, blind subjective review, or external packed adoption in this Task.

## Constraints

- Do not use internal/evals because the active adoption-certification Task owns that boundary.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`
- `docs/findings/F-20260804-skill-selection-proof-and-portability-gap.md`

## Steps

- [x] **Should this change stay at workspace scope, or should it be narrowed to one declared Scope?** (decision, complete) — Wide-scope Plans in monorepos drift faster and make Readiness less precise.
- [x] **Resolve plan decisions** (implementation, complete) — Answer the recommended ask-back questions before implementation so the agent does not guess on high-impact choices.
- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Execute deterministic Skill fixtures from versioned pack sources" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Refresh self-hosted knowledge state** (action, complete) — Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `maintenance.refresh-knowledge`: Required by Guard knowledge.refresh.
- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `knowledge.refresh`
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- Every declared Skill proof fixture resolves to one strict versioned fixture manifest and undeclared or duplicate fixtures fail validation. (closure, agent-observation)
- The runtime executes positive, negative, ambiguous, generated-output, capability-locality, and budget fixtures without a model or network call. (closure, agent-observation)
- Fixture reports bind exact pack, binding, project-source, capability, policy, rubric, and fixture identities and remain generated non-authoritative views. (closure, agent-observation)
- The Product UI Craft pack replaces prose-only selection fixtures with executable manifests and all deterministic expectations pass. (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard knowledge.refresh: Operating-model declarations require refreshed local knowledge (closure, source-bound-action)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] decision: The declared Task scope owns canonical decision Memory at docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md; review and synchronize it if project truth changes. (target: `docs/decisions/040-project-adapted-skill-packs-as-capability-projections.md`); resolution: memory-updated
