# Task: Keep observation Evidence valid across Git rename normalization while invalidating real source mutations

## Changelog

- `2026-08-12`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Keep observation Evidence valid across Git rename normalization while invalidating real source mutations

## Acceptance

- Observation validity is recalculated from the paths recorded by the observation, not from the current impact path universe.
- A dirty rename recorded before commit remains covered after commit and verify.
- A real mutation to a recorded source path still invalidates the observation.

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- Do not overwrite or absorb unrelated uncommitted verification and portability work.

## Admission And Workflow

- Workflow: `strict`
- Selected risk/detail: `high-impact` / `detailed`
- Recommended risk/detail: `high-impact` / `detailed`
- Selection source: `explicit-override`
- Reason: Declared ownership affects 2 non-workspace Scopes.

## Owned Paths

- `packages/cli/src/__tests__/observation-evidence-revalidation.test.ts`
- `packages/runtime/src/application/verification/verification.service.ts`

## Ownership Expansions

- None recorded.

## Steps

- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in Skopos Workspace** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Keep observation Evidence valid across Git rename normalization while invalidating real source mutations" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.
- [x] **Typecheck the Skopos workspace** (action, complete) — Required by Guard quality.typecheck.

## Actions And Guards

- Action `quality.typecheck`: Required by Guard quality.typecheck.
- Guard `quality.focused-behavior-proof`
- Guard `quality.typecheck`

## Evidence And Readiness

- Observation validity is recalculated from the paths recorded by the observation, not from the current impact path universe. (closure, agent-observation)
- A dirty rename recorded before commit remains covered after commit and verify. (closure, agent-observation)
- A real mutation to a recorded source path still invalidates the observation. (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.focused-behavior-proof: Behavior changes require focused proof (closure, agent-observation)
- Guard quality.typecheck: TypeScript changes require typecheck Evidence (closure, source-bound-action)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] architecture: High-impact work must review and synchronize the existing architecture Memory for Scope skopos. (target: `docs/architecture/00-architecture.md`); resolution: reviewed-no-change

## Portable Task State

This machine-readable block is the durable source used to rebuild local Skopos state.
